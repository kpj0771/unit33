    </div>
        <p>
        <span style="color:peru;font-style:italic;font-size:x-large; "> The Charge of the Light Brigade</span> was a failed military action involving the British
        light cavalry led by Lord Cardigan against Russian forces during the Battle of
        Balaclava on 25 October 1854 in the Crimean War. Lord Raglan had intended to
        send the Light Brigade to prevent the Russians from removing captured guns from
        overrun Turkish positions, a task for which the light cavalry were well-suited.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there was miscommunication in the chain of command and the Light Brigade
        was instead sent on a frontal assault against a different artillery battery,
        one well-prepared with excellent fields of defensive fire. The Light Brigade
        reached the battery under withering direct fire and scattered some of the gunners,
        but they were forced to retreat immediately, and the assault ended with very high
        British casualties and no decisive gains.
